Last updated: January 5, 2026

## 1. Agreement to Terms
By downloading, installing, or using ClipSummary, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the app.

## 2. Description of Service
ClipSummary is an AI-powered tool that summarizes text, video, and audio content. The Service is provided "as-is" and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy or completeness of the AI-generated summaries.

## 3. User Accounts
- You may need to sign in with a Google account to access certain features.
- You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service (via Google).
- We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

## 4. Credits and Usage Limits
- **Daily Credits**: ClipSummary provides a limited number of free credits (currently 3) which are renewed every 24 hours.
- **Renewal**: Credits are reset to the daily limit (3) if your balance is below that limit after 24 hours. Credits do not accumulate beyond the daily limit.
- **Fair Use**: Attempting to bypass these limits (e.g., by manipulating device time, using multiple accounts excessively, or exploiting system vulnerabilities) is a violation of these Terms and may result in a permanent ban.

## 5. Intellectual Property
The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of ClipSummary and its licensors.

## 6. User Content
You retain ownership of the content you submit to the app. By submitting content, you grant us a temporary license to process it solely for the purpose of generating your summary. You represent that you have the right to use and summarize the content you upload (e.g., you are not uploading copyrighted movies or illegal content).

## 7. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall ClipSummary, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.
